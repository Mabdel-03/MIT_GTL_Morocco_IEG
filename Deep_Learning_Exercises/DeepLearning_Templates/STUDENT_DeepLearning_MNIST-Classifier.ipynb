Your objective is to build and train two deep learning models using Pytorch, using the MNIST dataset for text classification, then compare the classification accuracy of the two models. The first model should bea simple multilayer perceptron, and the second should be a convolutional neural network. You have full autonomy over the hyperparameters, but after getting reasonable results (at least one model should get >95% accuracY) you need to explain why the model that did better was able to perform better. Good luck!\n","\n","P.S: Make sure you use a GPU runtime (change runtime in the upper right hand corner of the Colab, T4 runtime should be good enough).
